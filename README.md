# NFT-To-Testnet
A simple setup to deploy an NFT to a testnet, made for MPA workshop.

# Node.js Repositories Needed:
- truffle
- @truffle/hdwallet-provider or truffle-hdwallet-provider
- @openzeppelin/contracts@3.4.0
- web3

Note: installing these repositories individually is only necessary if you're creating your own project.  If you're using mine, simply use "npm install" and the package-lock.json will handle everything for you.

Have fun in the Hackathon!
